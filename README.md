Repository for the CODE BLACK (Miss Haven), a simple, minimal, easy-to-use, no website shenanigans, discord bot.


## What's Miss Haven?

Initially, I named this project Miss Haven, since I was designing it for one specific server called "Outer Haven". Later on, seeing the current trend of a new era of discord bots with new era of 'shit-enanigans' I decided to build one bot for this new era! Since I am still indecisive of the name 'Miss Haven', I have settled to call this project `CODE BLACK` for the time being.


## Aim 

I have seen enough discord bots doing the same things (claiming that they do it better than other bots) and the proceed to hide some of their best features (which are actually better than the rest) behind a paywall. CODE BLACK is a project started by [yours truly](https://github.com/ad4rsh2701) which aims to produce the following results:
- Make every feature free (excluding music player, for now), and as good as it can get
- Ensure everything stays inside discord (yes, no need to go to the "bot's website")
- Minimalism with Elegancy
- Community backed and open sourceability
- 100% Customization (my methods maybe rash, but hey they work!)


## Features

To be completed, I am still planning out the initial features Code Black with roll out with! Thank you for your patience!


## Invite bot and wait.. you want your own bot..? ON MY CODE?!

Sure!
(After all I made this repository public)

If you just want CODE BLACK, you can invite it to your server via this fancy button here:
(the bot's private at the moment, you will need to wait till it's first release!)

Now if you want your own bot! You can by cloning this repository (NOT NOW! When the code's completed of course!) 
Here are the detailed steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your Discord bot token by creating a `.env` file and add the following code:
    ```py
    BOT_TOKEN = your_discord_bot_token
    BOT_NAME = your_bot_name  # whitespaces are totally fine in names
    ```
4. Run the bot by running `main.py` file or by using `python main.py` in terminal.

## Contribution and Donations 

I am fairly good at discord bot development(I think, I hope...), but it is a given that multiple working on something produces better results than one. Hence, if you know the library [inetractions.py](https://pypi.org/project/interactions.py/) or even [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) feel free to contribute to this project! Yes, this bot is based on python, contrary to the other famous alternative JavaScript! 

Since, this is a completely free project, CODE BLACK will only survive on donations and my own personal expenses. At the moment, the bot isn't set up at such high levels that requires further fund aids. But I may require it if the bot grows!
